### Project 1

This project focuses on designing and implementing a custom class for Locally Weighted Regression (LWR), capable of handling multiple features and incorporating both training and testing data. The objective is to apply this implementation to a real-world dataset and evaluate its performance through 10-fold cross-validation to compute the mean square error (MSE).
